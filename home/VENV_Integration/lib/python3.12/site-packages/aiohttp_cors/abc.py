    """Router adapter for handling CORS configuration interface.

    `AbstractRouter` doesn't specify how HTTP requests are delivered
    to handlers, and aiohttp_cors doesn't rely on specific implementation
    details.

    In general Router can be seen as a substance that allows to setup handlers
    for specific HTTP methods and requests paths, lets call these Router's
    items routing entities.
    Generic Router is configured with set of routing entities and their
    handlers.

    This adapter assumes that its reasonable to configure CORS for same
    routing entities as used in `AbstractRouter`.
    Routing entities will be added to CorsConfig to enable CORS for them.

    For example, for aiohttp < 0.21.0 routing entity would be
    `aiohttp.web.Route` â€” tuple of (HTTP method, URI path).
    And CORS can be configured for each `aiohttp.web.Route`.

    In aiohttp >= 0.21.0 there are two routing entities: Resource and Route.
    You can configure CORS for Resource (which will be interpreted as default
    for all Routes on Resoures), and configure CORS for specific Route.
