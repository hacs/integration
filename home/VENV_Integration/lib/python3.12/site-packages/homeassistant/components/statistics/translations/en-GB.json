The configuration of the statistics integration will become more flexible with version 2022.12.0 and accept either `sampling_size` or `max_age`, or both settings. The request above prepares your configuration for this otherwise breaking change.\n\nRead the documentation of the statistics integration for further details: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/statistics/"
